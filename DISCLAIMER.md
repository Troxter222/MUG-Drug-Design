# ⚠️ DISCLAIMER & SAFETY WARNING

**PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SOFTWARE.**

## 1. Educational and Research Purpose Only
The Molecular Universe Generator (MUG) is a computational experiment in the field of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Cheminformatics**. It is designed solely for:
*   Academic research.
*   Demonstration of Deep Learning capabilities (VAE, GNN, RL).
*   Theoretical exploration of chemical space.

**This software is NOT a substitute for professional medical, pharmaceutical, or chemical expertise.**

## 2. Prohibited Uses
By downloading, running, or accessing this code, you agree **NOT** to use it for:
*   **Synthesis or Production:** Developing, producing, modifying, or synthesizing any real-world chemical substances based on the AI outputs.
*   **Pharmaceuticals:** Creating pills, drugs, supplements, or medical treatments for human or animal consumption.
*   **Controlled Substances:** Designing or manufacturing narcotics, psychotropics, toxins, or any compounds restricted by local or international law.
*   **Harmful Activities:** Any illegal, unsafe, or unethical activities, including the development of chemical weapons or hazardous materials.
*   **Bypassing Regulations:** Attempting to circumvent medical, safety, or legal regulations regarding drug discovery and chemical manufacturing.

## 3. No Medical or Scientific Advice
The output generated by this software (including chemical structures, toxicity predictions, and docking scores) is **theoretical** and generated by a probabilistic machine learning model.
*   **Accuracy:** The data may be inaccurate, hallucinated, or physically impossible.
*   **Safety:** The software cannot guarantee the safety or stability of any generated molecule.
*   **Clinical Use:** NEVER use AI-generated predictions to make health decisions or conduct biological experiments without expert supervision.

## 4. Limitation of Liability
The author(s) and contributor(s) of this repository:
*   **Do NOT encourage** or support any real-world chemical synthesis or harmful use of this software.
*   **Are NOT responsible** for any misuse, damage, injury, legal consequences, or unethical activities performed by third parties using this code.
